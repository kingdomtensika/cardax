<p>I accepted my position at Cardax as a seasoned veteran of the pharmaceutical industry. And, while my industry experience was indeed marked with satisfying projects, and even a successful drug launch with my former colleagues at Amgen, my most profound impression of modern drug development is in its epic failures. Particularly, the industry has failed to deliver the innovative new drugs that were to address society’s most dramatically unmet medical needs: The chronic and progressive age-related diseases including metabolic disease (liver disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome), arthritis, and neurodegeneration (cognitive decline and dementia).<span id="more-791"></span></p>
<p>Shock waves emanating from these decades-long drug development failures go way beyond balance sheets and patent cliffs. The persistent drumbeat of consolidation, with pharma mergers followed closely by R&amp;D contraction and lab closures, makes the point quite dramatically that the pharmaceutical industry’s focus has shifted away from medical need and toward the near-term bottom line. In 2014, at a time when our aging society needs it most, the pharmaceutical industry has stepped back from the challenge of these most difficult and devastating diseases, choosing instead to focus on lower risk acute infectious diseases and cancer.  This ensures that our aging population will face a future of unmanageable lifelong progressive disease requiring expensive patient care and resulting in heavily burdened healthcare systems around the world.</p>
<p>There is a concise reasoning for this failure to address the most dramatically unmet medical needs. In the early 1990s a confluence of new technologies promised to make drug development a more rational and “targeted” endeavor. The human genome was being solved and the golden age of biotechnology had provided insight into genetic markers of disease. The new biotechnologies enabled the development of transgenic disease models and provided ready access to isolated protein “targets;” these being the enzymes and receptors that were to be our drug intervention points for countless diseases. Miniaturization and automation technologies enabled high-throughput screening of large chemical collections in cell-free assays. Biological testing now had become “targeted biochemical screening.” But, in the end, after the near global implementation of these “high-throughput screening” methods, the study of isolated enzymes and receptors in little plastic wells ultimately proved to have little to do with the diseases we were trying to treat. The target-driven new technologies had largely failed to produce safe and efficacious drug candidates. These same technologies had, along the way, replaced much of the good biology and good pharmacology that had previously existed as the backbone of our drug development programs. To be sure, there is currently a “back to the future” effort to restore classical biology and a holistic “phenotypic” drug development paradigm but, across the industry, it seems the damage has been done.</p>
<p>So, as today’s risk-averse pharmaceutical industry steps back from the most dramatically unmet medical needs, Cardax is actively pursuing a solution. We simply asked the question: Why are age-related diseases age-related? Our answer: Age-related systemic inflammation drives chronic age-related disease. The normal processes of aging are associated with gradually increasing oxidative stress and inflammation. This normal aging can be enjoyed in relative good health given good nutrition and properly functioning antioxidant responses in our various tissues and organs. But, a lack of redox balance in one or more organs can accelerate oxidative stress and progressive age-related systemic inflammation—leading to one or more of the chronic age-related diseases including liver disease, arthritis, and dementia. Herein lies the common mechanism underlying all of the age-related diseases and also, quite possibly, the key to chronic disease treatment and prevention.</p>
<p>Currently available medicines do not address the root cause of the chronic age-related diseases. The pharmaceutical industry’s paradigm for drug development and clinical testing is necessarily focused on “downstream” symptomology. The Cardax anti-inflammatory therapeutics, derived from natural nutrients with centuries of human exposure, impact the earliest “upstream” mechanisms of chronic disease and aim to normalize systemic inflammatory processes and slow or even halt disease progression before the appearance of severe symptoms and thereby lessen or perhaps even prevent the need for expensive patient care. For example, currently marketed drugs that treat one of the largest unmet medical needs, rheumatoid arthritis, focus on more advanced symptoms and a particular pathogenic biomarker known as TNF-alpha.  These treatments require patients seeking relief to inject anti-TNF agents with significant side-effects and yet still have global annual sales of about $28B.<sup>1</sup> In contrast, Cardax’s first oral product, astaxanthin, addresses the mechanisms causing the pathological overproduction of TNF-alpha in the first place but without the side effects of these agents. Astaxanthin could, by regulating the “upstream” cellular processes that lead to pathological TNF-alpha overproduction, safely restore normal levels of TNF-alpha and treat these large patient populations therapeutically and perhaps even preventatively.</p>
<p>Cardax plans to continue its disruptive therapeutic approach.  We are planning Phase II clinical programs to demonstrate efficacy in multiple therapeutic areas including osteoarthritis, liver disease, metabolic syndrome and age-related cognitive decline. The Cardax product platform including astaxanthin and its various orally bioavailable formulations promises to deliver robust efficacy and superior safety to nutraceutical and pharmaceutical consumers in both the earliest and later stages of chronic age-related disease.  Given the current hesitancy of the pharmaceutical industry, it seems to me that Cardax is particularly well-positioned to carry out the mission to treat and prevent age-related chronic disease and thereby address the dramatically unmet medical needs of our time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="http://cardaxpharma.com/about-us/management-team/david-g-watumull-president-and-ceo/">David G. Watumull</a>, Cardax President and CEO</p>
<p>It is my distinct pleasure to welcome you to the first Cardax blog post. Our goal is to provide timely and interactive communication for investors and others interested in our Company.  In addition to formal press releases and SEC filings we make available through other channels, we hope to offer personal perspective on several relevant areas, including the Company’s progress, capital markets, and relevant developments in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries.</p>
<p>As you know, Cardax is developing a new class of oral anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals – highly potent but without the side effects of traditional treatments. But where did this breakthrough come from and how did we get started?</p>
<p>I was a life science investment banker and biotech analyst in the mid 1990’s. I was trying to find financing for a company out of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla with a novel photo-bioreactor technology that allowed, for the first time, production of photosynthetic organisms.</p>
<p>Their first product was the microalga Haematococcus pluvialis that produced astaxanthin, the compound that gives salmon its distinctive pink color.  Management believed strongly that this “natural” version of a synthetic compound already in wide-spread use in the salmon feed industry would enjoy rapid acceptance, despite its decidedly higher cost and low production volume.  Unfortunately, discussions with salmon feed manufacturers quickly disavowed me of the product’s commercial viability in that market, where price competition and large, secure supply capacity dominated.</p>
<p>The company was clearly dismayed that there was no market for their product in the salmon feed business. But as we disappointedly sat around a beer later, discussions moved to the benefits of astaxanthin for salmon. Yes, company scientists said, salmon were grey (and not very pretty) without it, but salmon without astaxanthin were smaller, didn’t reproduce as well, got more infections, and, if released, were not strong enough to swim upstream!</p>
<p>Immediately, my analyst background kicked in and I thought, “Wow, that’s a lot more than pink” and as we discussed the data supporting astaxanthin’s benefits, including its potential anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activity, an idea began to form. Clearly, because humans have eaten salmon for thousands of years, astaxanthin at the doses found in salmon was safe.  Instead of a fish feed product, perhaps the company could develop a human dietary supplement or nutraceutical where pricing and volume were not so crucial? At the time, there were no astaxanthin dietary supplements available.</p>
<p>I proposed this idea to the company but they did not want to develop a dietary supplement themselves and asked if I could lead that effort.  As a biotech analyst, I was well aware of the coming major challenges facing the biopharmaceutical industry, including the patent issues and drug discovery challenges that continue to roil life science companies to this day and I knew a safe, powerful anti-inflammatory was a disruptive game changer.</p>
<p>I was eager to pursue the opportunity so I joined the company and in 2000 we brought out an astaxanthin dietary supplement. The FDA has confirmed the safety of these types of dietary supplements and several astaxanthin products now enjoy a GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) status, the agency’s highest safety designation.</p>
<p>Even after we commercialized this product, the earlier production problems continued and I became convinced that a much larger market for astaxanthin, including pharmaceutical uses, could develop but only if reliable, mass-market volumes with competitive pricing could be achieved. To accomplish this goal, I proposed developing, through a partner, large-scale production of a nature-identical synthetic astaxanthin but the founders and management of the company wanted to stick to the company’s foundational microalgal technology – which I understood.</p>
<p>So I left and formed what has now, through several iterations, become Cardax.</p>
<p>Today, the role inflammation plays in chronic disease is well accepted and understood scientifically. Inflammation is now thought to be the underlying causative factor in many of the largest chronic diseases including arthritis, diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, CNS disease, and liver disease.</p>
<p>This opportunity has not gone unnoticed in the biopharmaceutical industry with dozens of anti-inflammatory drugs under development at large and small companies alike.  Many of these drugs are efficacious – but most are not suitable for chronic, every day use.</p>
<p>Synthetic, nature-identical astaxanthin, with its pharmaceutical-grade purity, mass-market scale, competitive pricing, efficacy, and safety we expect will solve these issues.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and see you back here soon.</p>
